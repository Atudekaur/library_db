library database


creating database
creating tables using primary and foriegn keys 
inserting values
primay key:A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values.
Foreign Key: A foreign key in one table references the primary key of another table. 
             Referential Integrity: It enforces referential integrity, meaning you can't add a foreign key value to a table if it doesn't exist as a primary key in the                         referenced table. 
            Example: In an Orders table, a CustomerID column could be a foreign key referencing the CustomerID (primary key) in the Customers table. This ensures that                        every order is associated with a valid customer.
